#Interactions between Characters 
Once the main characters have been extracted, it is useful to find the network of interactions between them. there will be an interaction between two characters every time they both appear within a six-line section. 
Whether this choice is appropriate or not depends on the circumstances. The result is an indirect weighted graph: the weight of the edges represents the number of interactions between the linked characters.

If the size of the section for the detection of the characters interactions changes, how the network and the associated centrality measures will change? 
And how are these measure correlated one respect to the other?

# Sentiment analysis 
From the plot we can detect sudden changes in the character lives, for instance in the case of the character "Pierre", in the books 12, 13, 14. 
What happened? 
it is possible to show a cloud of words related to him and to these books.

# Conclusion

--

* As seen, the methods of text analysis have also been found to be useful for revealing the structure of networks, and in turn the methods of network science prove to be useful in analyzing the text.

--

* The interaction network has proved to be robust to changes in node and edge detection methods, and equally robust were centrality measures such as degree centrality, strength and betweenness. 

--


* Morevore the text analysis allows to understand the main topics of the book and to detect the principal events in the lives of the characters.
